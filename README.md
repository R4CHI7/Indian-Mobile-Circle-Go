Indian-Mobile-Circle-Go
-----------------------

Small Golang library to display the mobile operator and circle for Indian numbers.

This can work for more cases except a few:
* The mobile number owner has changed to a different operator using Mobile Number Portability (MNP)
* The mobile number owner has shifted to another state without changing the number.

Based on <a href="https://github.com/rahulchordiya/Indian-mobile-circle" target="_blank">this library.
